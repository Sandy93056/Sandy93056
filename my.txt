# Practice Problem # 

# The task you have to perform is “Your Age In 2090”.
# evaluate your performance.

# Problem Statement:-
# Take age or year of birth as an input from the user. Store the input in one variable. Your program should
# detect whether the entered
# input is age or year of birth and tell the user when they will turn 100 years old. (5 points).

# Here are a few instructions that you must have to follow:
# Do not use any type of module like DateTime or date utils.
# Users can optionally provide a year, and your program must tell their age in that particular year.

# Your code should handle all sorts of errors like :

# You are not yet born
# You seem to be the oldest person alive
# You can also handle any other errors, if possible!


# Solution Here #

yearAge = int(input("What is your Age/Year of birth\n"))
isAge = False
isYear = False

if len(str(yearAge)) == 4:
    isYear = True

else:
    isAge = True

if (yearAge < 1900 and isYear):
    print("You seem to be the oldest person alive")
    exit()

if (yearAge > 2019):
    print("You are not yet born")
    exit()

if isAge:
    yearAge = 2019 - yearAge

print(f"You will be 100 year old in {yearAge + 100}")

interestedYear = int(input("Enter the year you want to know your age in\n"))

print(f"You will be {interestedYear - yearAge} years old in {interestedYear}")
